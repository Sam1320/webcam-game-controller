# Webcam Game Controller

This is a simple demonstration of how to use a webcam and a *very small* neural network to control a game in realtime. No pre-trained models or any other data is used. All the design, data collection, data processing, and training is done from scratch.

The demonstration video is found on `webcam_game_controller/demo.mp4`

To test the system run:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
